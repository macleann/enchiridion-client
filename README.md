# Enchiridion Client

The Enchiridion Client is a front-end client application for The Enchiridion, a TV playlist-making app with a Django backend interfacing with The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Currently, the app allows users to search through any show already within The Movie Database (TMDB). **Now, you can also sign in with Google!** Plans are in place to allow users to like playlists and to make the Home page more robust with most recent playlists and most liked playlists. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
- **Sign in with Google!**
- Ability to create, view, update, and delete custom playlists.
- Sleek user interface designed with Tailwind CSS and Material UI.
- Browsing functionality for shows, seasons, and episodes, made possible by interfacing with the TMDB API.
- Hosting via Azure
